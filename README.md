* __(course - Free)__ _Python for Data Science_ (UCSD) _EdX.org_ class:
  - Link: https://www.edx.org/course/python-for-data-science-0
  - Notes: Archived version. Designed to be 8-10 hours of effort/work per week but you can go at your own pace.
  
* __(article)__ __Towards Data Science__: _Python Basics for Data Science_:
  - Link: https://towardsdatascience.com/python-basics-for-data-science-6a6c987f2755
  - Notes: It's a pretty good primer on the basics of python (data types, functions, methods, etc). It serves well as a reference sheet in the future.

* __(course - Not Free -- usually $9.99)__ _Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp_:
  - Link: https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/ 
  - Notes: Jose Portilla from Pieran Data (his startup I think) has a bunch of great courses on Udemy. They are all usually "on sale" at $9.99 and even though it's not free it's a pretty good deal because you go from very beginner python  to some powerful machine learning algorithms (if you understand the basics of programming in any other language you'll be ok). 

* __(course - Free -- 4 hours total)__ _Intro to Python by __DataCamp___: 
  - https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science
  - This is a very short intro course (4 hours total) but it'll get you started on the right track.

* __(online platform)__ https://codechalleng.es 
  - These are a bunch of bite-sized exercises to _"hone your python skills in the comfort of your own browser"_
  - Not focused in data science but I find it useful to not forget simple details.

* __(tutorials)__ Data Science tutorials at _Real Python_:
  - https://realpython.com/tutorials/data-science/
  - _Real Python_'s website has been adding more and more tutorials regarding data science. They are focused on specific tasks (reading/writing CSV files, cleaning data, text classification, etc) and they are very thorough. These are text tutorials, not video.

* __(video tutorials)__ Corey Schafer's youtube channel:
  - beginner python series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYXdXT2l-Gg&list=PL-osiE80TeTskrapNbzXhwoFUiLCjGgY7 
  - Corey Schafer's channel is full of tutorials on all things related to software development (git, command line, python, javascript, etc). 

* __(video tutorials)__ PyCon and SciPy:
  - These tutorials last about 3 hours (there's a lot of downtime between exercises) and their code is on GitHub. You can follow along at your own pace and they're a pretty good start in general. Especially if you already know some programming. 
    - `Pandas` for Data Analysis (SciPy 2017) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGzU688xCUs 
    - Intro to `python` and Programming (SciPy 2018) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmxy2NU9LOI 
    - `Pandas` for Data Science (PyCon 2018) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hsKLYfyQZc 

* __(blog posts)__ Anna-Lena Popkes -
  - She did a _#100DaysOfCode_ challenge to learn `python` (for machine learning) and documented her journey in a series of blog posts where she created a "magical world" to explain what a Class is, inheritance, functions, etc. It's very easy and entertaining to follow.
    - Day 1: http://alpopkes.com/posts/2018/07/coding-challenge-day-1/ 
    - GitHub: https://github.com/zotroneneis/machine_learning_basics 
    - She had an interview on _[Talk Python to Me](https://talkpython.fm)_ (podcast - :star::star::star::star::star: 100% recommend) where she explains the whole thing  https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/186/100-days-of-python-in-a-magical-universe 

* __(examples)__ Lots of python code snippets to study, recreate, or save you when you're stuck
  - https://www.pythonprogramming.in/ 

* __(online courses - Free)__ Multiple tracks to learn many different Data Science skills -
  - https://cognitiveclass.ai/
